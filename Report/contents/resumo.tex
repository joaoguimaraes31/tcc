This paper aims to design the automation of a testbench for brake tests. There are already consolidated standards rules for brake system testing, this research project is focused with respect to \textit{SAE J2522} regulation  that addresses on brakes tests on passenger vehicles. The major focus of the project is to ensure a resilient solution for the testbench in order to make possible the acquisition of all relevant physical information and to automate the tests.
