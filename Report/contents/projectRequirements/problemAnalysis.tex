\section{Problem Analysis}

	As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:purpose} this project aims on developing a functional brake test bench. Based on the \textit{SAE J2522} \cite{sae} and considering some instrumentation engineering concepts the project solution can be divided in the structure showed in Figure \ref{fig:projectProblem}.
