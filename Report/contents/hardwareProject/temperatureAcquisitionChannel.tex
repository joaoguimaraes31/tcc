\section{Temperature Acquisition Channel}
			
	 For this project it was defined that thermocouples of type K (formed by the junction of two metal leagues: Alumel and Cromel) would be used in this project. This is because this specific type of thermocouple has a wide range of operation (-200$^{\circ}$C - $^{\circ}$C), so according to the requirements they are never too close from the boundary values, a thermocouple of type T or even a type J would not be suitable. Other appealing factor is that this type of thermocouple is quite common so getting eventual replacements would be easier, in comparisson with type E thermocouples.
