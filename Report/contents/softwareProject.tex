\chapter{Software Project}

	This project has two layers of software that communicates with each other, the microcontroller program and a program executing in a computer. There were some functionalities that could be implemented on either layers, as the computer hardware is obviously superior than the microncontroller hardware everything that could be implemented in either layers was implemented in the computer software.
