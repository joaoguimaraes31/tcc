	\section{Purpose of the project}\label{sec:purpose}
		The purpose of this work is too develop, implement and test a microcontrolled electronic instrument system for monitoring and controlling a small scale brake-testbench based on the information from the internationl regulation \textit{SAE J2522} \cite{sae}. The system will comprehend both software and hardware layers and should be able to perform brake tests and acquire physical data through sensors in order to judge brake systems components level of performance.
