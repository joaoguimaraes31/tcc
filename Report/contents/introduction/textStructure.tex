	\section{Text Structure} 
	
	The rest of this paper was divided on chapters briefly explained bellow.
	
	\textbf{Chapter 2, Literature Review: } This chapter will explore somo concepts and aspects of engineering and of brake tests that are considered fundamental to following parts of this paper.
	\par
	
	\textbf{Chapter 3, Methodology: }
	This is the where the strategy for developing this paper and the engineering solutions it proposes are dicussed.
	\par
	
	\textbf{Chapter 4, Project Requirements: }
	On this chapter the project requirements, both from hardware and software will be enumerated. Also, based on this requirements the parameters that the final solution will have to monitor in order to meet thoose requirements will be listed.
	\par
	
	\textbf{Chapter 5, Hardware Project: }
	This chapter provides a detailed explanation of each of the hardware solutions that were either developed, integrated or implemented on this project.
	\par
	
	\textbf{Chapter 6, Software Project: }
	This chapter is basically splitted in two parts, one for explaining the code from the bottom layer of the solution (low level hardware) and one for explaining the code from the upper layer (high level hardware).
