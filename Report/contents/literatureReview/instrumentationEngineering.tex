\section{Instrumentation Engineering}	

	Instrumentation engineering has existed for long but only recently it has become a independent field of engineering. The instrumentation engineer has a wide variety of work, designing, developing, installing, managing equipments that are used to monitor and control machinery \cite{careerIndia};
	\par
	Instrumentation engineering may be defined as the branch of engineering that focus on the principle and operation of measuring and control instruments \cite{webster2014measurement}. This kind of engineer may be responsible for integrating the sensors with signal condition circuits and data acquisition systems, transmitters, displays or control systems. Sometimes the instrumentation engineer is the person acquainted to estipulate the hardware/software trade-offs, because this engineer has the proper knowledge to decide which solutions are more feasible and economically viable either using hardware or software solutions \cite{mandell1972hardware}.
	\par
	\say{Instrumentation and control engineers work with the industries with the goal of improving productivity, optimisation, stability, reliability, safety and continuity. These engineers design, develop, and maintain and manage the instruments and the instrumentation systems. Instrumentation engineer is the person who takes call on what kinds of instruments are needed for ensuring efficiency and quality of the end product}\cite{instrumentation-control-engineering-perfectionists}.
